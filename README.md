# How to use it

## QTCreator

The easiest way to play the game is to download the content and open PandaPunch.qbs with QTCreator. Make sure you have OpenFramework and ODE on your device.
In QTCReator go to the PandaPunch.qbs and change line 6 the import path to where you have Openframeworks/libs stored on the devie and set the root path on line 9.
Then under the QBS Files/Modules/ode ode.qbs file change the patch on line 4 where you have ode stored.

When all of this is done you should be able to press the green play button and play the game.
